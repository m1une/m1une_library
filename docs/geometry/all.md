## Overview

`geometry/all.hpp` includes the complete 2D geometry module.

## Included Headers

| Header | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `geometry/angle_sort.hpp` | Atan-free counterclockwise angle sorting around an arbitrary origin. |
| `geometry/point.hpp` | Points, vectors, dot/cross products, exact orientation, distance, and rotation. |
| `geometry/convex_hull.hpp` | Monotone-chain convex hull with optional boundary-collinear points. |
| `geometry/farthest_pair.hpp` | Euclidean farthest pair with original indices in $O(N\log N)$. |
| `geometry/half_plane_intersection.hpp` | Bounded intersection polygon of directed closed half-planes in $O(N\log N)$. |
| `geometry/lattice_point_count.hpp` | Exact lattice-point counting in a bounded intersection of integer linear inequalities. |
| `geometry/manhattan_mst.hpp` | Manhattan minimum spanning tree for integral points in $O(N\log N)$. |
| `geometry/line.hpp` | Lines, segments, projection, intersection, and distances. |
| `geometry/ray.hpp` | Rays, containment, projection, intersections, and distances with other linear objects. |
| `geometry/rectangle_union_area.hpp` | Exact union area of axis-aligned rectangles in $O(N\log N)$. |
| `geometry/polygon.hpp` | Area, centroids, triangulation, containment, ray queries, intersection, clipping, and Minkowski sums. |
| `geometry/circle.hpp` | Circle relations, line/ray intersections, and ray reflection. |

Integral predicates promote to signed 128-bit arithmetic. Constructions that
may be non-integral return `Point<long double>`.
