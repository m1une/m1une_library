title: Shortest Path
documentation_of: ../../graph/shortest_path.hpp
---

## Overview

`graph/shortest_path.hpp` includes the shortest-path algorithms whose behavior
respects the adjacency stored in `Graph<T>`.

Most of these algorithms are direction-respecting and can be used on directed
graphs as written or on undirected graphs built with `add_edge`. The exception
is `dag_shortest_path`, which is specifically for directed acyclic graphs.

## Complexity

This header is an include bundle and provides no runtime operation by itself.
See the included algorithm pages for public interfaces and complexities.
