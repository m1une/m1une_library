## Overview

`optimization/all.hpp` includes optimization algorithms whose public interface
is not naturally a graph, data structure, or algebraic object.
The public namespace is `m1une::opt`.

Convex tools such as CHT, Li Chao tree, slope trick, Alien Trick, and Monge
routines live under `convex/`.
