# m1une's library

C++20 library for competitive programming by [m1une](https://atcoder.jp/users/m1une).

This repository is organized as header-only building blocks. Data structures live in
`ds/`, and reusable algebraic definitions live in `monoid/` and
`acted_monoid/` so they can be combined without rewriting boilerplate during a
contest.

## Structure

| Directory | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `graph/` | General graph algorithms and builders, including range edges, shortest paths, components, cycles, Namori decomposition, DAGs, 2-SAT, lowlink, and MST. |
| `tree/` | Rooted-tree metadata, LCA, HLD, virtual trees, diameter, tree hashing, rerooting DP, static top tree variants, and centroid decomposition. |
| `flow/` | Flow-network algorithms such as max flow, min-cost flow, and bounded flow. |
| `optimization/` | Project selection, slope trick, Hungarian assignment, simplex LP, and integer LP. |
| `matroid/` | Uniform, partition, graphic, and linear matroids, plus weighted and unweighted matroid intersection. |
| `monge/` | SMAWK, D&C DP, Knuth optimization, LARSCH, Monge checks, and structured min-plus/max-plus convolution. |
| `matrix/` | Dense row-major matrices, fast multiplication and powers, Gaussian elimination, determinant, inverse, and linear systems. |
| `fps/` | Fast modular, integer, and floating-point convolution, formal power series operations, Lagrange inversion, multipoint evaluation, interpolation, and linear recurrences. |
| `sequence/` | Sequence algorithms such as longest increasing subsequence, inversion counting, and meet-in-the-middle subset sum. |
| `geometry/` | 2D points, lines, rays, segments, polygons, convex hulls, and circles. |
| `ds/` | Categorized data structures for range queries, online/offline dynamic connectivity, dynamic sequences and trees, ordered sets, and hash tables. |
| `monoid/` | Reusable monoids for generic data structures such as `Segtree`. |
| `acted_monoid/` | Acted monoids for lazy propagation data structures such as `LazySegtree`. |
| `math/` | Base conversion, extended GCD, modular arithmetic, Lucas binomials, tetration, Stern-Brocot paths, combinatorial sequences, sieves, factorization, CRT, and floor sums. |
| `string/` | Z/KMP, edit distance, Manacher, eertrees, suffix automata/arrays, tries, Aho-Corasick, and string hashes. |
| `utilities/` | Fast I/O, parsing, dice, integer helpers, compression, random generation, stress testing, and general contest utilities. |
| `verify/` | Online Judge Verify Helper tests. |
| `docs/` | Markdown documentation for the public headers. |

### Data structure categories

| Directory | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `ds/dsu/` | Connectivity, component aggregation, potentials, and persistent union-find. |
| `ds/segtree/` | Dense and dynamic segment trees, lazy propagation, dual segment trees, and persistent variants. |
| `ds/range_query/` | Fenwick trees, static sparse-table queries, and wavelet matrices. |
| `ds/dynamic_array/` | Implicit-treap sequences with insertion, deletion, reversal, aggregation, or persistence. |
| `ds/ordered_set/` | Ordered sets and multisets, including persistent variants and binary tries with optional monoid aggregates. |
| `ds/dynamic_tree/` | Link-cut trees and rake-compress trees for changing forests. |
| `ds/dynamic_connectivity/` | Online and offline connectivity under edge insertions and deletions. |
| `ds/hash_table/` | Hash maps and hash sets. |

See [`ds/README.md`](ds/README.md) for the complete header index.

## Usage

Include headers directly from the repository root and compile with C++20:

```cpp
#include "ds/segtree/segtree.hpp"
#include "monoid/add.hpp"
```

Most generic data structures are parameterized by a monoid or acted monoid, so prefer the ready-made definitions in `monoid/` and `acted_monoid/` when possible.

```cpp
using Sum = m1une::monoid::Add<long long>;
m1une::ds::Segtree<Sum> seg(std::vector<long long>{1, 2, 3, 4});

seg.set(1, 10);
long long answer = seg.prod(0, 3);  // 1 + 10 + 3
```

To shrink an expanded submission, run the dependency-free compressor. It removes
comments and redundant whitespace and conservatively shortens variable names:

```sh
python3 compressor.py bundled.cpp -o submission.cpp --stats
```

Pass `--no-rename` to keep all identifiers unchanged. The compressor preserves
preprocessor lines, string and character literals, and raw strings.

## Documentation Conventions

* Ranges are half-open: `[l, r)` includes `l` and excludes `r`.
* Indices are zero-based.
* `prod(l, r)` means "fold the values in `[l, r)` with the selected monoid".
* Lazy segment trees use acted monoids: the value monoid describes queries, and
  the operator monoid describes updates.
* Some monoids store metadata in their `value_type`. When a monoid provides
  `make(value)` or `make(value, index)`, the data structures use it automatically
  while building from a vector of another type.

## Verification

The repository is configured for `online-judge-verify-helper`. Locally, the core verification files can also be compiled with:

```sh
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -I. verify/ds/segtree/segtree.test.cpp
```
